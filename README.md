Hey! I'm Katie, a senior studying CS at CMU. I like machine learning, with a particular interest in multimodal ML and Bayesian statistics. At CMU, I have TAed [Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) and [Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/). 

This summer, I worked on ML-powered video insights at LinkedIn media infrastructure. Previously, I built unsupervised ML models for testing at Apple Maps, analyzed stocks at Dualitas Capital Management LLC, and researched osteoarthritis at Stanford Medicine.  

When I'm not going crazy debugging or trying to solve a problem, Iâ€™m usually collecting half-formed ideas that might one day become essays. Still waiting for the right excuse to write them.
