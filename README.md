# Greetings! My name is Katie.

### I study Computer Science and Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I'm broadly interested in machine learning, with a particular interest in multimodal machine learning and Bayesian statistics. 

I currently TA [10423/623: Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) (F24) and volunteer for [CMIMC](https://cmimc.math.cmu.edu/). 

I spent the past summer as a Software Engineer Intern at Apple Maps working on unsupervised machine learning for exhaustively testing iOS 18 features. I used to TA [15122: Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) (F23, S24). I previously interned at Dualitas Capital Management LLC and worked on bioinformatics research with Dr. Qian Wang and Dr. Shady Younis at the [Robinson Lab @ Stanford University](https://robinsonlab.stanford.edu/).
