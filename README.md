Hey! I'm Katie, a senior studying CS at CMU. I'm broadly interested in machine learning, especially generative models. At CMU, I have TAed [Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) and [Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/). 

This summer, I worked on ML-powered video insights at LinkedIn media infrastructure. Previously, I built unsupervised models for testing at Apple Maps, analyzed stocks at Dualitas Capital Management LLC, and researched osteoarthritis at Stanford.  

When I'm not going crazy debugging or trying to solve a problem, Iâ€™m often collecting half-formed ideas that might one day become essays. Still waiting for the right excuse to write them.
