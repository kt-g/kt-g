Hello! I'm Katie, and I study CS + Stats at CMU. I'm broadly interested in machine learning, and I care deeply about how AI can be used to augment and improve our lives. At CMU, I have TAed [Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) and [Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/). 

Right now I'm writing an s-expression compiler in Rust and a deep learning library compatible with Apple Silicon. Previously, I maximized video engagement at LinkedIn, built testing frameworks at Apple Maps, analyzed stocks at Dualitas Capital Management, and researched osteoarthritis at Stanford.  

When I'm not going crazy trying to solve a problem, I’m often collecting half-formed ideas that might one day become essays. One day.
