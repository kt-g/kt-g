# Hey there! My name is Katie Guo.

### I study Statistics and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I currently TA [15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) and contribute math problems to [CMIMC](https://cmimc.math.cmu.edu/). 

I spent the past summer as a Data Analyst Intern at Dualitas Capital Management LLC working on stock return analysis. In high school, I lead web development and scouting analytics for [Iron Claw Robotics](https://ironclaw972.org/) and conducted bioinformatics research with Dr. Qian Wang and Dr. Shady Younis at the [Stanford Medicine Robinson Lab](https://robinsonlab.stanford.edu/).
