# Greetings! My name is Katie.

### I study Computer Science and Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I'm broadly interested in machine learning, with a particular interest in multimodal machine learning and Bayesian statistics. 

This summer I will be working on infrastructure at LinkedIn. 

I spent the past summer as a Software Engineer Intern at Apple Maps working on unsupervised machine learning for exhaustively testing iOS 18 features. I used to TA [10423/623: Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) (F24) and [15122: Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) (F23, S24) and previously interned at Dualitas Capital Management LLC. In high school, I worked on bioinformatics research at the [Robinson Lab @ Stanford University](https://robinsonlab.stanford.edu/). 

Beyond STEM, I am interested in philosophy and essay-writing. I have a lot of scattered thoughts on various topics; perhaps I will put pen to paper one day.
