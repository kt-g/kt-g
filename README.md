Hello! I'm Katie, and I study CS + Stats at CMU. I'm broadly interested in machine learning, especially generative models. At CMU, I have TAed [Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) and [Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/). 

Right now I'm working on two cool projects: an s-expression compiler built in Rust and a deep learning library compatible with Apple Silicon. Previously, I maximized video engagement at LinkedIn, built testing frameworks at Apple Maps, analyzed stocks at Dualitas Capital Management, and researched osteoarthritis at Stanford Robinson Lab.  

When I'm not going crazy debugging or trying to solve a problem, I’m often collecting half-formed ideas that might one day become essays. One day.
