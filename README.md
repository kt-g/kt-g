# Greetings! My name is Katie.

### I study Statistics and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Right now, I'm mainly interested in multimodal machine learning, but some of my secondary interests include Bayesian statistics and parallel computing. 

I currently TA [10423/623: Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) and contribute math problems to [CMIMC](https://cmimc.math.cmu.edu/). 

I spent the past summer as a Software Engineering Intern at Apple Maps working on unsupervised machine learning for exhaustively testing iOS 18 features. I previously TAed [15122: Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) (F23, S24). I previously interned at Dualitas Capital Management LLC, and in high school, I worked on bioinformatics research with Dr. Qian Wang and Dr. Shady Younis at the [Robinson Lab @ Stanford University](https://robinsonlab.stanford.edu/).
