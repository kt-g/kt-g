Hello! I'm Katie, and I study CS + Stats at CMU. I TA [Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) and do research at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/). I've also TAed [Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) and written math problems for [CMIMC](https://cmimc.math.cmu.edu/). 

I'm broadly interested in machine learning, and I care deeply about how AI can be used to augment and improve our lives. 

Previously, I maximized video engagement at LinkedIn, built testing frameworks at Apple, analyzed stocks at Dualitas Capital Management, and researched osteoarthritis at Stanford Medicine.  

When I'm not going crazy trying to solve a problem, I’m often collecting half-formed ideas that might one day become essays. One day.
