# Hi, I'm Katie.

### I study Computer Science and Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I'm broadly interested in machine learning, with a particular curiosity about multimodal machine learning and Bayesian statistics. 

This summer, I interned at LinkedIn as a Software Engineer on the Media Infrastructure team, working on ML-powered video insights. Before that, I was at Apple Maps building unsupervised machine learning systems to test iOS 18 features.

I used to TA [10423/623: Generative AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10423/) (F24) and [15122: Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) (F23, S24). I've also interned at Dualitas Capital Management LLC, researched osteoarthritis at Stanford University, and written a lot of code that probably shouldn't have worked but did. 

When I'm not going crazy debugging or trying to solve a problem, Iâ€™m usually collecting half-formed ideas that might one day become essays. Still waiting for the right excuse to write them.
