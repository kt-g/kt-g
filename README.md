# Hey there! My name is Katie Guo.

### I study Statistics and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I currently TA [15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) and contribute math problems to [CMIMC](https://cmimc.math.cmu.edu/). 

In high school, I was the lead web developer and head of analytics and strategy of my robotics team. I also conducted bioinformatics research with Dr. Qian Wang and Dr. Shady Younis at the Stanford Medicine Robinson Lab.
